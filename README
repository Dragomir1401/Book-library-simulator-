Tema 2 - The Library of HashBabel

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

____________Description___________

    This project is based on hashtables functionalities in C.
We use a generic implementation to store each part of the implementation.
This library has capacity to store books of hashmap type and logs about users.
In the end we create a top of books based on the rating received and of users
based on the score acumulated.

    We use multiple ".c" files. The main one calls function which parses input
based on the command received from input. We use another function source besides
the hashmap basic functions for creating the last tops and freeing all the
resources in this project.

    This project works by creating a hashtable of books(library) and a hashtable
of users(system). In the hashtable of books each entry is a structure which 
holds a book(hashtable type) and details of the book. Commands supported:

- add book
- rmv book
- get book
- add def
- rmv def
- get def
- add user
- borrow book
- return book
- lost book 

    This project uses a system of points for users and a system of rating
for the books. It also uses a system of errors for certain unsupported
situtaions.

_____________Comments_____________

    The implementation could have been done better based on the genericity of
the code. Besides this I could have made a more modularized approach. The
structure follows parse_input functions, hashmap functions and other functions.
    I learned from this project how to use hashtables and how hashing works
I also learned how to manage errors and memory leaks and the fact that some
errors can spread and cause other problems of ouput or memory.
